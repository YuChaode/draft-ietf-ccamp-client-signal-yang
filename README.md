# A YANG Data Model for Transport Network Client Signals

## Scope

This is the working area for the [IETF CCAMP](https://datatracker.ietf.org/wg/ccamp/documents/) WG Internet-Draft, "[A YANG Data Model for Transport Network Client Signals](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-ccamp-client-signal-yang/)".

## Abstract

   A transport network is a server-layer network to provide connectivity
   services to its client.  The topology and tunnel information in the
   transport layer has already been defined by generic Traffic-
   engineered models and technology-specific models (e.g., OTN, WSON).
   However, how the client signals are accessing to the network has not
   been described.  These information is necessary to both client and
   provider.

   This draft describes how the client signals are carried over
   transport network and defines YANG data models which are required
   during configuration procedure.  More specifically, several client
   signal (of transport network) models including ETH, STM-n, FC and so
   on, are defined in this draft.
